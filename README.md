### How do I get set up? ###

#### Enable flags ####
Many of the Chrome Apps APIs are still experimental, so you should enable experimental APIs so that you can try them out:
Go to chrome://flags.
Find "Experimental Extension APIs", and click its "Enable" link.
Restart Chrome.
####Load your app####
To load your app, bring up the apps and extensions management page by clicking the settings icon  and choosing Tools > Extensions.

Make sure the Developer mode checkbox has been selected.

Click the Load unpacked extension button, navigate to your app's folder and click OK.

####Open new tab and launch####
Once you've loaded your app, open a New Tab page and click on your new app icon.

####Or, load and launch from command line####
These command line options to Chrome may help you iterate:

* **--load-and-launch-app=/path/to/app/** installs the unpacked application from the given path, and launches it. If the application is already running it is reloaded with the updated content.

* **--app-id=ajjhbohkjpincjgiieeomimlgnll** launches an app already loaded into Chrome. It does not restart any previously running app, but it does launch the new app with any updated content.
